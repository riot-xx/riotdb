Project: R with I/O Transparency (RIOTDB) Library
         With MySQL at the backend
Author:  Herodotos Herodotou

Description: This library allows the RIOTDB prototype package to interface
             with the msql database.

General Files:

- config.h
    Contains the database location and credentials.

Library files:

- basics.c/h
    Contains necessary constants, the RDBVector definition, the RDBMatrix
    definition and functions for initializing, copying, clearing and loading
    RDBVectors and RDBMatrices.

- compare_vectors.c/h
    Contains functions for vector comparisons with other vectors or values.

- convert_vectors.c/h
    CContains functions for performing data type conversions for vectors.

- delete_vector_data.c/h
    Contains functions for deleting elements from vectors (delete all,
    single values, range of values or sparse values).

- get_matrix_data.c/h
    Contains functions for accessing elements in vectors (get all, single
    values).

- get_vector_data.c/h
    Contains functions for accessing elements in vectors (get all, single
    values, range of values, sparse values, with other dbvectors as indexes
    or with logic dbvectors).

- handle_matrix_tables.c/h
    Contains functions for managing matrix tables (create, delete, dublicate,
    check for N/A).

- handle_matrix_views.c/h
    Contains functions for handling matrix views (i.e create, drop,
    materialize views and keep track of view references)

- handle_metadata.c/h
    Contains functions for managing the matadata table.

- handle_vector_tables.c/h
    Contains functions for managing vector tables (create, delete, dublicate,
    check for N/A).

- handle_vector_views.c/h
    Contains functions for handling vector views (i.e create, drop,
    materialize views and keep track of view references)

- insert_matrix_data.c/h
    Contains functions for inserting data to an EMPTY matrix either explicitely
    or load from a file

- insert_vector_data.c/h
    Contains functions for inserting data to a vector either explicitely
    or load from a file

- matrix_function.c/h
    Contains functions for matrices (multiplication)

- set_vector_data.c/h
    Contains functions for updating elements in an existing vector (setting a
    single value, range of values, sparce values, with dbvectors containing
    indexes and logic vectors).

- sort_vector.c/h
    Contains a method used to sort numeric vectors

- vector_aggregate_functions.c/h
    Contains aggregate functions for vectors (sum, avg, max, min).

- vector_binary_ops.c/h
    Contains functions for binary operators for vectors (+, -, *, /, %).

- vector_element_functions.c/h
    Contains element-wise functions for vectors (sin, cos, pow, sqrt).
